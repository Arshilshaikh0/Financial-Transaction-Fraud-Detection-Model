# Financial-Transaction-Fraud-Detection-Model

The objectives of predicting fraud transactions using machine learning are as follows:

Identifying fraudulent transactions as early as possible to minimize financial losses.
Creating a robust model that can accurately detect fraud in real time, even as fraud patterns evolve over time.
Automating the fraud detection process to reduce the time and resources required to review transactions manually.
Reducing the number of false positives (legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraudulent) to minimize customer inconvenience and improve customer satisfaction.
Generating actionable insights from the data to help identify patterns and trends in fraudulent activity, which can be used to improve the system’s overall security.
Incorporating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand why certain transactions are predicted to be fraudulent and help improve the interpretability and transparency of the model.
Continuously monitor and evaluate the model’s performance to ensure that it meets the objectives over time.
